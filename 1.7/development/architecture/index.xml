      <description>Understanding the &amp;ldquo;src&amp;rdquo; folder The main idea when doing the 1.7 release was to use Symfony as a replacement for our own PrestaShop framework.

 Core: the refactored classes or business logic extraction for PrestaShop 1.7; Adapter: the classes that still depends on legacy framework (Context, Dispatcher or constants for instance); PrestaShopBundle: the classes that acts as a glue between PrestaShop classes and Symfony  Core .</description>
