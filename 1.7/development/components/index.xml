      <description>The Faceted Search Architecture This document describes the faceted search architecture that is being implemented in PrestaShop 1.7.
Please also read the extensive comments in classes/controller/ProductListingFrontControllerCore, as this document is only a high-level explanation.
The target audience is anybody who wants to develop a well-integrated search module that replaces the way the PrestaShop core searches for products.
At the moment this proof of concept works only on the CategoryController but it is easy to extend to the other product controllers (manufacturers, supplier&amp;hellip;).</description>
