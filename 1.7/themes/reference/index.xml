      <description>Migrating from PrestaShop 1.6 PrestaShop 1.7 introduces a totally reworked theme system from version 1.6, with the goal of making PrestaShop upgrades easier, and making it easier and faster to create a brand new theme.
The huge change to the theme system means that there is no easy way to migrate your PrestaShop 1.6 theme to PrestaShop 1.7.
When using the automatic upgrade from PrestaShop 1.6 to 1.7, your theme will be switched to the new default theme, called &amp;ldquo;Classic&amp;rdquo;.</description>

      <description>Overriding modules When you write a theme, you often need to override the templates and assets coming from a module so that they match your theme&amp;rsquo;s specific markup needs. Themes can override modules&amp;rsquo; assets (CSS and JavaScript only) by placing the corresponding file at a specific location.
With PrestaShop 1.7, all module overriding code goes to the modules directory (in your module&amp;rsquo;s own directory). Every PS 1.7 module developer should be aware of this change (introduced with PR 5020: https://github.</description>

      <description>RTL support PrestaShop supports RTL (Right-to-left) themes natively.
RTL stylesheets There are two ways of customizing your theme for RTL: either by adding an override file that is only loaded for RTL languages, or by using completely different version of the theme&amp;rsquo;s stylesheets.
CSS override file PrestaShop will try to load a css file named rtl.css after your theme&amp;rsquo;s ones when displayed in an RTL language. You can use this file to place any style override you need for RTL.</description>

      <description>Helpers: functions and modifiers {url} PrestaShop 1.7 introduces a new Smarty helper to generate URLs. This will take care of SSL, domain name, virtual and physical base URI, parameters concatenation, and of course URL rewritting.
{url} uses the Link class internally.
Please see the $urls dataset to find already regenerated urls (such as home, cart, login and so on).
 An instance of the Link object is still passed to the templates for backward compatibility purposes, since it was heavily used.</description>
