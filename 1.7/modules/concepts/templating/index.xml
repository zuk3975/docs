      <description>How to override Back Office views  Since PrestaShop 1.7, the back office is being progressively migrated to the Symfony framework. Even though modules are no longer allowed to override a complete controller like before (it was highly discouraged anyway), we have introduced new powerful and more efficient ways to customize the Back Office.
As part of this migration, PrestaShop is switching its templating engine from Smarty to Twig. Twig is very popular in the PHP/Symfony world, it&amp;rsquo;s well-documented and it&amp;rsquo;s also one of the most efficient engines out there.</description>
